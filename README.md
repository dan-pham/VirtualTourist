# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree - VirtualTourist App
This repository contains the VirtualTourist app from Udacity's Data Persistence course. This app connects to a public RESTful API, Flickr,
to download photos and utilizes Core Data to save user pins and photos. Core Data is also used to persist the user's most recent map 
interaction so the user will be presented with the same map upon starting the app.

## Overview
VirtualTourist allows users to drop a location pin on a map to view photos of that location. The photos that appear are downloaded from 
Flickr and stored for faster access the next time the user selects that same pin. The user can select multiple photos to delete in that 
collection or the user can choose to delete that collection entirely and be presented with a new one.
